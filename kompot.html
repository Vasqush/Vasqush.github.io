            <h3>Bokor National Park</h3>

              <p>
                The Bokor Hill is 1,075 meters high, and promises good weather and magnificent views. Big trees casting shadows over the water and rocks shaped as animal figures hold particular interest for tourists. The mountain overlooks Kampot Town, Kep Beach, Preah Sihanouk Province and blue sea water.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the main attraction in and around Kampot. Unfortunately at the time of writing it is largely closed to visitors as the road is being repaired. Bokor hill station was built by the French as a high-altitude complement to the fashionable seaside resort of Kep across the bay. Both are now faded and crumbling in a very atmospheric fashion. Bokor was also the scene of fierce fighting in the '80s, with Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese troops battling it out across the mountaintop for control of the buildings and the rest of this strategic area of high ground.

            <h3>Popokvil Waterfall</h3>
            <img src="images/popokvil-waterfall.jpg" alt="" />
            <article>
              <p>
                Popokvil waterfall is situated on Bokor Mountain – a popular destination for tourists in Kampot Province thanks to its pleasant cool weather and beautifully landscaped hill. Just a few kilometers calculated from the hill station, the falls lie right at the edge of the highland march which covers much of the mountain-top. Because of the poor state of these bridges that cross the streams zig-zaggin over the hill, you will have no choice except walking the last kilometer to the waterfalls. It is pretty pleasant to walk, and if you are lucky enough, you may even catch sight of some interesting wild-life, such as giant red squirrels or monkeys. Even when coming to the waterfall might be a little bit challenging, but as soon as you see at firsthand the natural beauty of the falls, then you absolutely know, with no doubt, that it is definitedly worth your efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The waterfall's name, Popocvil, in Khmer, means “Swirling clouds” which is absolutely appropriate as almost every time, the waterfall is covered above by a thick mist that makes it look like an amazing scense in heaven. Popokvil Waterfalls is a two tiers waterfall with its first tier is around 15-metre high while the second one is about 18m high. The most ideal time to visit this waterfall is during the rainy season, from June to October because the waterfall is the most beautiful at this time. Popokvil waterfall is not only a great place for a swim on a sweltering day but also a very nice place to take pictures.
