                The National Museum of Cambodia is where you can find the
                cultural side of Cambodian history that dates back to the 4th
                century. The museum is housed within an impressive red sandstone
                structure and inaugurated in 1920 as the Musée Albert Sarraut
                during the French colonial period. It stands out as a fine
                illustration of traditional Khmer architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are over 14,000 interesting exhibits, arranged according
                to prehistoric, pre-Angkor, Angkor, and post-Angkor eras, each
                of which comprises bronze and wooden sculptures, ceramic items,
                ethnographic items and stone articles. Check out spectacular

            <article>
              <p>
                Cambodian Living Arts is a non-profit organisation that hosts
                Apsara and traditional Khmer dance performances at the National
                Museum of Cambodia. Tickets are priced from US$15 and shows are
                held on Mondays, Wednesdays and weekends from 7pm onwards. The
                organisation preserves traditional Khmer dance that dates back
                to the 18th century but was almost lost under the Khmer Rouge
                regime.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cambodian Living Arts revived the art by gathering surviving
                master artists to train and pass on their knowledge to younger
                generations. The troupe comprises live singers and musicians in
                traditional Khmer costumes, performing eight classical dances of
                ethnic minorities from all over Cambodia.

                Wat Phnom is a temple that sits on a hill to the north of Phnom
                Penh. The temple was restored and reconstructed through several
                years, namely in 1434, 1806, 1894 and 1926.
              </p>

                Wat Phnom is a symbol of the Cambodian capital city and is
                regularly visited by local devotees who either come for prayers,
                bring small offerings, or participate in meditation.

                Oudongk is a town at the foot of the hill of the same name

              <p>
                The Killing Fields, also known as Choeung Ek Memorial, is a
                bone-chilling reminder of Cambodia’s tragic history. About 17 km
                south of Phnom Penh City, it is one of the many killing fields
                or execution and burial grounds used by the Khmer Rouge regime
                during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mass graves were discovered after the Khmer Rouge fled the city,
                leading to the construction of a Buddhist memorial for over
                15,000 victims in The Killing Fields. Half-day tours to this
                memorial and S-21 Prison feature informative audio guides in
                many languages as well as testimony from survivors and guards of
                the regime.

            <img src="images/tul-sleng.webp" alt="" />
            <article>
              <p>
                Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum was formerly Tuol Svay Pray High
                School before it was turned into an interrogation, torture and
                execution centre by the Khmer Rouge regime. Also known as S-21
                Prison, an estimated 17,000 Cambodians entered this notorious
                venue. Only 7 managed to survive until the end of the regime.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most rooms have been left in the state they were found in
                January 1979, including classrooms divided into tiny cells. An
                essential stop while visiting Phnom Penh, Tuol Sleng Genocide
                Museum also displays 6,000 haunting portraits of its prisoners
                for travellers to understand the recent tragic Cambodian
                history. It's an intense experience touring the old prison and
                will no doubt give you plenty of food for thought.

                Phnom Penh is not as active as Siem Reap when it comes to Khmer
                performing arts. Even so, you can find some of the performing
                arts schools in the city are open to the public during the day,
                allowing you the opportunity to observe dancers in training.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among these, a must-see is the Sovannaphum Arts Association &
                Art Gallery on 111 Street 360 (corner of Street 105). Started in
                1994 by a group of students from the Royal University of Fine
                Arts in Phnom Penh, the association has a theatre where
                traditional cultural shows are staged every Friday and Saturday
                night at 7.30 pm.

                Diamond Island Development City, one of the major development
                sites in Phnom Penh is set to transform into a smart city in
                three to five years.​
              </p>
              <p>
                Located along Tonle Bassac River in Phnom Penh, Diamond Island,
                popularly known as Koh Pich, measures more than 100 hectares.
                Starting from 2006, a small island known as “Koh Klong” was
                developed and transformed into new CBD and nowadays considered
                as prime area of Phnom Penh Capital. Today, the city has become
                the “Diamond of Phnom Penh”, dominated by construction projects.
                With panoramic views of the city, Diamond Island Development
                City is home to high-end residential areas, entertainment,
                exhibition centres, commercial units, and convention halls.
