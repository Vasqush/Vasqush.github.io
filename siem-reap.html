          Siem Reap (Khmer: សៀមរាប, Siĕm Réab [siəm riəp]) is the second-largest
          city of Cambodia, as well as the capital and largest city of Siem Reap
          Province in northwestern Cambodia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Siem Reap has French colonial and Chinese-style architecture in the
          Old French Quarter and around the Old Market. In the city, there are
          museums, traditional Apsara dance performances, a Cambodian cultural
          village, souvenir and handicraft shops, silk farms, rice paddies in
          the countryside, fishing villages and a bird sanctuary near Tonlé Sap,
          and a cosmopolitan drinking and dining scene. Cambodia’s Siem Reap
          city, home to the famous Angkor Wat temples, was crowned the ASEAN
          City of Culture for the period 2021–2022 at the 9th Meeting of the
          ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Culture and Arts (AMCA) organised on
          Oct 22, 2020.[3]

            <h3>Angkor Wat</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.thecrazytourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ccimage-shutterstock_127561268.jpg" alt="angkor-wat" />
            <article>
              <p>
                Magical, mysterious, and absolutely mesmerizing, Angkor Wat is
                one of those bucket list places that every human should
                experience before they die. Here is the largest Buddhist temple
                on earth, which took 30 years to build during the 12th century
                (113-5BC) and spans over 208 hectares (500 acres).
              </p>
              <p>
                It is said that Angkor Wat was built as funereal temple for King
                Suryavarman II, with each structure representing phases of life,
                death, and beyond. As you stroll through one of history’s lost
                civilizations, climbing marble stairs and ducking through
                stone-structured archways, you’ll get an architectural glimpse
                into a world long forgotten.

              <p>
                Whether you’re looking for a half-day tour on the red dirt roads
                of Siem Reap, or want to go on a 2-day all or 7-day dirt bike
                excursion around Cambodia, there’s lots of available tours that
                can make it happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are tours like the 1-day trip to Phnom Kulen, which is a
                sacred mountain with hidden waterfalls, lush jungle forest, and
                long stretches of open dirt road to tear up, as well as tours
                like the 6-day excursion that takes you in a massive loop around
                the country and includes accommodation and fuel.

            <h3>The Old Market</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.thecrazytourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ccimage-shutterstock_1104311633.jpg" alt="old-market" />

              <p>
                Get the local experience at The Old Market, or as the locals
                call it “Psar Chaa”. Built in the 1920’s, here is where
                residents of Siem Reap come to get their produce, grains, and
                meat for homecooked meals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The market is divided into small sections selling different
                goods. Go to the fruit section where you can get organic fruit
                like mangosteens and dragon fruit at local prices, walk down the
                dim alleyways of the meat section where you’ll find freshly made
                sausages hanging on strings, or walk through the rows of vendors
                sitting on straw floor mats selling dried seafood.

              <p>
                Decades have passed since both the Vietnam War and the Khmer
                Rouge regime, but life-threatening reminders still remain hidden
                in the fields of Cambodia; 6 million reminders to be exact. The
                Cambodia Landmine Museum is the best place in Siem Reap to
                educate yourself on the whos, whats, and whys regarding
                landmines in Cambodia.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to a history lesson and an up-to-date briefing on
                the landmine situation, you’ll all get to see some active and
                detonated landmines up close. You’ll learn about how it has
                affected locals and see what efforts are being made to rid the
                region of these hidden dangers.

                Here’s your chance to have an intimate experience with animals
                native to Cambodia while also contributing to a great cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right here in Siem Reap is one of the most vital wildlife
                conservation centers in the north of Cambodia. The Angkor Centre
                for Conservation of Biodiversity works towards the advancement
                of species and habitat preservation through several channels
                including species breeding, animal rehabilitation, community
                education, and conservation and research.

            <article>
              <p>
                When you want the total spa treatment but don’t want to spend
                half of your travel budget on getting it, that’s when you come
                to Lemongrass Garden. Just a couple dollars more than the common
                sub-par massage shops that you pass in the touristy areas,
                Lemongrass Garden is a professional experience that will leave
                you feeling positively pampered.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a lavish experience, try out the 4-Hands Massage offered in
                the form of full-body, legs, Khmer massage and more. They also

            <h3>Angkor Pottery Center</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.thecrazytourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Angkor-Pottery-Center.jpg" alt="pottery" />
            <article>
              <p>
                Learn the basics of pottery making techniques just like the
                ancient Cambodians from Angkorian times. Spend the day at the
                Angkor Pottery Center with English-speaking pottery teachers
                where you’ll learn to make pots, vases, and bowls. Get ready to
                get your hands messy while you sit at the pottery wheel and spin
                wet clay to form beautiful and functional pieces. You’ll fire
                them in a ceramic oven where they harden and become the best
                souvenirs to take home. This is a fantastic cultural experience
                and an all-around fun time in Siem Reap.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pottery class is a great activity for groups, couples, solo
                travelers, and even children. Classes are just 30 minutes so
                consider grouping this activity into your day of Angkor Wat
                sight seeing.

                Talk to a tuk tuk driver to help you find a guide for the Kulen
                Nature Trails. These rainforest trails offer hidden gems in the
                rainforest such as ancient temples, respected monasteries, and
                rushing waterfalls. You’ll walk along a gorgeous river and under
                cool, shady trees making for a much-needed escape from the heat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you reach the waterfall, there will be vendors selling
                snacks and beverages. Stock up and have a picnic under one of
                the pagodas next to the waterfall.

                One of the best ways to see the true Cambodia is on a cycling
                tour in the countryside. Take the “Off the Beaten Track” tour
                with Butterfly Tours Asia where you’ll ride through the villages
                of Siem Reap, gaining insight into how rural Cambodians live
                their day-to-day life.
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll embark on a 20-kilometer adventure over 4 hours with an
                English-speaking guide. You’ll pass rice fields, lazy cows,
                Khmer villages and busy farmers. The locals who you’ll meet
                along the way are very friendly and the children will be very
                excited to see you.
