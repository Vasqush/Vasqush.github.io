                    You need a visa to visit Cambodia. Tourists can apply for an e-visa online or get a tourist visa on arrival. These are valid for 30 days.
                    For longer stays or other situations, get a visa through an embassy or consulate of Cambodia. Don&apos;t overstay your visa. This is a serious offence.
                    You&apos;re required to stay at least one night after entering Cambodia, except when travelling via Phnom Penh International Airport. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.
                    Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Cambodia for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

                  <p>The weather is hot all year round, but peaks in March and May when temperatures can reach around 32°C and above.
                    In December and January, the weather is dry, but the temperatures are slightly cooler - it&apos;s usually expected to be approximately 25°C - 30°C (77F - 86F) at this time of year.
                    The cooler part of the season between November and February is the peak time for tourism. Mild enough to explore temples in comfort but warm enough to sunbathe by the coast.
                    May to October brings around 75% of the countries annual rainfall. The rainy season is humid, and temperatures will still be high.

                    Cambodian authorities enforce &apos;modesty&apos; laws at sites of religious significance, such as Angkor Wat. Dress respectfully, including covering your knees and shoulders. You can&apos;t enter if you don&apos;t.
                    Don&apos;t take photos of people without their permission, especially monks and other religious figures. It&apos;s culturally inappropriate.
                    Avoid taking photographs near sensitive sites, such as: military areas; assets or military personnel, transport facilities, and government buildings.

                    Amok is one of the best-known Cambodian dishes, but you&apos;ll find similar meals in neighboring countries. The addition of slok ngor, a local herb that imparts a subtly bitter flavor, separates the Cambodian version from the rest of the pack.
                    The curry is made with fresh coconut milk and kroeung. Traditionally the dish was made with either fish or snails, but now you can find chicken and even vegetarian versions.
                    At upscale restaurants amok is steamed with egg in a banana leaf for a mousse-like texture, while more homestyle places serve a boiled version that is more like a soupy fish curry.

                    Our tour leaders are exceptional! They are fluent in English and Khmer, and some other rural dialects as well. 
                    Some more regional rural guides may not speak English as well as those in metropolitan areas, but certainly make up for it with their welcoming hospitality. 
                    Our tour leaders all complete the Cambodia national guide certification program, which takes three months. In addition, we do our own Adventure Life training that focuses on customer relations and tour specifics.
                    Many were born and raised in the local areas where they guide and are among the very best guides available in each region. Some specialize in specific adventure activities as well, such as hiking. 
                    All of our tour leaders treat our travelers like friends, showing visitors both the major highlights and the local treasures.

                    No, a guide for the Angkor Complex is not required and it is an entirely up to visitors to decide if they need guide service or not. 
                    A guide will definitely enrich your experience and can offer you detailed cultural, historical information and save much of your time on considering or researching but may prefer to go without a guide. 
                    A local English speaking guide service is generally charged from $35 per day without sunrise or adventure/remote trips. Tour guide service can be arranged by your hotel, guesthouse and other local travel agencies.

                    Cambodia tours utilize a variety of transportation including private vans/cars, 4x4 vehicles, internal flights, etc.
                We use a mix of private/public transit to provide travelers with the safest and most efficient transportation in each area.
                Although, we do not utilize public transportation very often. Occasionally, we may include non-typical transportation modes (tuk-tuk, bicycle taxi, etc.) for short distances to give travelers a sense of local flavor.
                Each tour itinerary page has a description of the transportation included on that tour. If you have additional questions, just ask!

                    In each location, we strive to use charming accommodations that are locally owned and characteristic of the area. 
                    These range from charming, family-run bed & breakfasts to luxurious, boutique hotels. Most hotels have private baths, hot water and clean, comfortable rooms except in instances where noted, such as a homestay. 
                    We strive to also find hotels in good locations, whether that be walking distance to main attractions or out of the city if it is consistently noisy. 
                    Larger hotels are used in metropolitan areas as typically these are the only available options. Some rural hotels may be family run lodges that only offer shared bathroom facilities and freshwater showers.
